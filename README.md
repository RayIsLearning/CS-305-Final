# CS-305-Final
Artemis Financial wanted to enhance their security protocols. 
I have done the following to enhance their security:
Generated self-signed certificates using the Java keytool, deployed SHA-256 as an algorithm cipher, and refactored the code for HTTPS.
These measures increased the security layers.
After refactoring the code, I did not see any additional CVE's apparent in the OWASP dependency report.
This assignment was helpful to combine all concepts that were taught in this course.
